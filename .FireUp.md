# FireUp

FireUp is a stripped-to-bare-bones Python project template creator.

It somehow resembles projects like [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) or [`pyscaffold`](https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffold) regarding the shared aim, but it has been designed with a crucial difference in its premise. FireUp goal is to provide a hard-coded and restricted set of template features while reducing at most the dependencies required to do so.

Its name is inspired to [Google's Python Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire#why-is-it-called-fire): while it fires off a Python script, FireUp lets you to initialize your Python project.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>= 3.6)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/#documentation)

## Usage

To initialize a new python project with FireUp, all you need to do is clone this gist repo and install FireUp via `pip install -e .` in the virtual enviroment you want to run your experiments. It's now sufficient to execute

```python
fireup
```

and you will be prompted for project creation setup. Once the project folder has been created, you can cd into it from your base Python enviroment and execute `make create-env`.

You are now ready to further setup your project switching to the brand new enviroment and browsing all the default possibilities through `make help`.
